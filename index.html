        <p>This project was created as part of a Data Science module as a university project. It is neither
            trying nor claiming to be 100% accurate in its scientific approach. Its purpose is to help me learn and
            understand how the work with
            big amounts of data from an API works, how to clean and process these inputs and how to present them in a
            fashionable way.

        <h3>League of Legends</h3>
        <p>League of Legends is a MOBA video game by Riot Games. There are different game modes, one of them is called
            "Ranked Solo/Duo". This will be the only mode covered in this analysis since it's the most important and
            respected one. Playing this mode grants League Points (LP), which determine the rank of a player. Winning
            games means winning LP, losing games means losing LP. There are 10 rank tiers in total, 7 of which are
            divided into divisions reaching from 4 (lowest) to 1 (highest). The highest three ranks are not divided into
            divisions, but have only one division each. The tier and division of a player make up
            their rank, for example:
        </p>
        <li>
            <il>Tier: Silver</il>
        </li>
        <li>
            <il>Division: 2 (II)</il>
        </li>
        <li>
            <il>Rank: Silver II</il>
        </li>
        <p>All we need to know for now is the order of these tiers, from lowest (Iron) to highest (Challenger):</p>
        <p>Iron >>> Bronze >>> Silver >>> Gold >>> Platinum >>> Emerald >>> Diamond >>> Master >>> Grandmaster >>>
            Challenger</p>
