            Riot Games <a href="https://developer.riotgames.com/apis" target="_blank">offers an API</a> for easy and
            public access of
            game and player data. After signing up and generating an API key you can send requests from specific content
            and receive that content as a json file.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are different kinds of json files used in this analysis:
            <a href="masteries_puuid_challenger_1.json" target="_blank">masteries</a>,
            <a href="page_1_player_7.json" target="_blank">players</a> and
            <a href="EUW1_69450_altered.json" target="_blank">games</a>.
            The mastery files are from the 300 Challengers in EUW at the time of 15th June 2024. All initial player
            files are from either Silver II or Platinum II players (100 games each) who were at this rank on that date.
            The game files are from the recent 100 Ranked Solo/Duo games of those 200 players at that time, making it
            20,000 games in total. Additionally to the first downloaded 200 players, I then downloaded player
            data from all players participating in these 20,000 games which weren't downloaded already. All following analysis is
            based on this data.
